          <h2>Imagine, if you will...</h2>
        <p>Realizing that I’d need to learn a different style of coding made me nervous. But going from the basics of Python to the basics of JavaScript in my new LaunchCode class was not as challenging as I thought it’d be.</p>
        <p>A few days ago a guest speaker mentioned the importance of not allying ourselves with a particular code, but instead to ally ourselves with the mission of learning whatever we need to learn in order to solve a problem.</p>
        <p>I felt that that was an important distinction; it removes the limitations that we might place on ourselves. The harder part might be to actually free ourselves to do that. It’s easy to adopt a favorite “anything” — whether that be a coding language, an approach to coding (style), whatever. We are creatures of habit…quite literally.</p>

          <h2>Agility bottled in just a few pages</h2>
        <p>The bestseller, “The Power of Habit” by Charles DuHigg, discusses the nature and composition of habits: how they’re so key to the unconscious decisions we make that even businesses have tapped into how to access them and use our “habits” to direct our decision-making process (to the profit of the company’s bottom line, of course). Most importantly, the book discusses how we can, too, use knowledge of our vulnerabilities to redirect our habits so as to result in healthier outcomes that benefit ourselves–and hopefully those we care most about. The question is, then, at least as far as coding (and then, maybe beyond that) what should one do in order to become accustomed to being flexible–and, then, remaining flexible? How does one avoid building–or change–the habit of holding tightly to the code, structure, approach what we know and hold dear? </p>
        <p>I once heard of a term that is/was supposedly used by dancers: “a brick”. It’s essentially an insult, referring to someone (i.e. the general public) who is no longer flexible enough to–say–swing our legs past our head lol. And I can’t help but think: “I don’t want to become a brick…in programming.” </p>
        <p>So how do I make sure I don’t become a brick? Should I be doing something right now to help me remain code-flexible? If so, what? Learning different types of code even as I’m learning JavaScript and, soon, C# ? Perhaps continue brushing up on my Python and maybe start looking at Java’s syntax? Or should I focus on learning what I’m learning, get decent at that, before moving on to other stuff? Oy, I think my brain is tired just considering the prospect of dumping more on it right now. Still, it’s something to think about.</p>
